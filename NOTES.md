- I am assuming the model structure will not change

- this is not the best implementation if there is potential of there being more options, such as color, owner, location, etc

- I liked setting up the redux, it was quit intuitive.

- I really liked the base file structure, I will definitely be using it as a base for my react projects

- Some challenges I encountered sorting the data by a specific attribute.

- Lastly, I understand using a Form structure would have made this a little but more simpler. I just wasn't sure.
